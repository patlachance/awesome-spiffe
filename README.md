# Awesome SPIFFE
This repository contains a curated collection of awesome software things related to the SPIFFE and SPIRE projects. It is broken down into sections, each describing a different type of awesome thing (e.g. SPIRE plugins, SPIFFE issuers, etc).

This curation is maintained by the SPIFFE project with help from the community. If you know of something awesome that is not listed here, please send a PR!

## SPIFFE-aware Software
